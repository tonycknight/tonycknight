Hi, I'm Tony. I'm a Lead Engineer, gamer and incorrigble nerd.

## Some projects

[Tubescan](https://github.com/tonycknight/tubescan) - a Discord bot for tube status, to find the optimal time to dash from the pub.

[Nomoretrolls](https://github.com/tonycknight/nomoretrolls) - a Discord bot for policing chat. Winding up Discord trolls turns out to be remarkable fun, and a nice thought experiment.

[kvps-cli](https://github.com/tonycknight/kvps-cli) - a dotnet CLI tool for local key value storage

[tktk-cli](https://github.com/tonycknight/tktk-cli) - an eclectic set of tools wrapped in a dotnet CLI
